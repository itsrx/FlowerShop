      <p> Waterloo Flowers is brough to you buy software engineering students from Waterloo. Our idea
        arose from a school project and we realized that many students around campus do not have any plants
        in their homes. Studies show that plants can help boost positivity and can help reduce stress. Our
         goal at Waterloo Flowers is to help students improve their health by selling low maintenace flowers!
